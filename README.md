# Graph Analysis using Multi-Agent Collaboration with LLMs 
Reimplemented the research paper [GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18032v2) to develop multi-agent systems optimized for understanding data within graph representations.
